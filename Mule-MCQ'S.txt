Q6.
When designing an upstream API and its implementation, the development team has been advised to not set timeouts when invoking downstream API.
 Because the downstream API has no SLA that can be relied upon. This is the only donwstream API dependency of that upstream API. Assume the downstream API

ANSWER:AThe invocation of the downstream API will run to completion without timing out.
Q7.
An API has been updated in Anypoint Exchange by its API producer from version 3.1.1 to 3.2.0 following 
accepted semantic versioning practices and the changes have been communicated via the API's public portal. The API endpoint does
 NOT change in the new version. 
How should the developer of an API client respond to this change?
ANSWER:A) The API client code ONLY needs to be changed if it needs to take advantage of new features.
Q8.
A new upstream API Is being designed to offer an SLA of 500 ms median and 800 ms maximum (99th percentile) response time. 
The corresponding API implementation needs to sequentially invoke 3 downstream APIs of very similar complexity. The first of these downstream APIs offerS
 the following SLA for its response time: median: 100 ms, 80th percentile: 500 ms, 95th percentile: 1000 ms. If possible, how can a timeout be set 

in the upstream 
API for the invocation of the first downstream API to meet the new upstream API's desired SLA?
ANSWER:A) Set a timeout of 100 ms; that leaves 400 ms for the other two downstream APIs to complete
Q9.
An organization has several APIs that accept JSON data over HTTP POST. The APIs are all publicly available and are associated with several mobile
